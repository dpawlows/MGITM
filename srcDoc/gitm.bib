abstract = {We consider the problem of identifying unknown physical processes and estimating inaccessible parameters in the global ionosphere and thermosphere model (GITM). In previous work, we took advantage of developments in the retrospective cost method to estimate unknown thermal conductivity and rate coefficients in a one dimensional column in the atmosphere. In the present work, we extend the application of this method to the identifi- cation of unknown inaccessible parameters in 3D GITM, as well as the identification of the unknown subsystem that governs the radiative nitrous oxide cooling process in 1D GITM.},

abstract = {Classic approaches in modeling planetary atmospheres, which are based on kinetic transport coefficients, have an upper limitation in altitude due to the transition from collisional to noncollisional regions; consequently, models developed until now have been constrained under the exobase. Furthermore, such models require hypotheses for diffusion coefficients, thermal conductivity, and viscosity in the case where several major species coexist in the medium. In order to solve the whole atmosphere from the ground to the heart of the exosphere, we have developed a new one-dimensional model based on a collisional approach. This was applied to Mars, using a 13-moment approximation in order to obtain profiles of the concentrations, velocities, temperatures, heat fluxes, and stress tensors versus altitude for each of the main species (CO2, N2, O2, CO, O, and H). The aim was to validate our mathematical approach and study the dominant physical processes versus altitude. The relevance of the approximations used in classic models was evaluated, and new phenomena that appear above the exobase are presented, all of which have important consequences on concentration, velocity, and temperature profiles. Finally, some modifications are proposed to classic approaches in order to incorporate such mechanisms, and perspectives of the model are presented concerning the interactions between the upper atmosphere and the space environment.},

abstract = { An on-line data base consisting of the auroral oval boundaries, structure, and particle fluxes from the DMSP F7 and F9 satellites from December 1983 through the present (with about an 7-month lag) is announced. The data are divided into distinct regions (e.g., diffuse aurora, discrete aurora, cusp proper, polar rain, etc.). The magnetospheric sources of the various particle precipitation regions are identified using a sophisticated pattern recognition technique (a neural network). For each region the boundaries are specified in both geographic and geomagnetic coordinates, and the average and peak values of the particle fluxes are given, along with the average energies. The DMSP satellites are continuously monitored, so that data gaps are comparatively rare. It is anticipated that the location of the auroral oval (and precipitation intensities) will be of particular interest to ground-based observers; although anyone interested in the state of the auroral oval may find it of value. SPAN data requests are processed on a completely automated basis, with up to 48 hours of auroral oval parameters provided in response to a single request. },

abstract = { The series of polar-orbiting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spacecraft TIROS, NOAA 6, and NOAA 7 have been monitoring the particle influx into the atmosphere since late 1978. This data base has been used to construct statistical global patterns of height-integrated Pedersen and Hall conductivities for a discrete set of auroral activity ranges. The observations of energy influx and ``characteristic electron energy'' have been binned in a 1$\,^{\circ}$ latitude and 2$\,^{\circ}$ magnetic local time grid and ordered by an auroral activity index. This index is an estimate of the energy deposited into a single hemisphere by incident particles, a parameter generated directly from the particle observations and, therefore, internally consistent with the statistical patterns that are constructed. An average electron spectrum is associated with each characteristic energy, which enables a height profile of ionization rate in the upper atmosphere to be determined. The use of a pressure coordinate system insures that the normalized ionization rate profiles are independent of atmospheric model parameters. To create the statistical pattern of height-integrated conductivities, however, vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and composition are assumed, and the ion density enhancements are evaluated from a chemical balance between ion production and recombination based on an ``effective'' recombination coefficient. The data base can also provide the statistical pattern of particle heating rates and ionization rates over a three-dimensional grid suitable as input to more sophisticated ionospheric and neutral thermospheric codes. },
